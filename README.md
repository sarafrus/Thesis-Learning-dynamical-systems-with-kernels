Learing dynamical systems with kernels

Kernels are a powerful methodology to learn dynamical systems.
This work proposes, beside of a deep theoretical explanation, also practical application to forecast dynamical systems starting from different training datasets. Computational experiments demonstrate the good level of accuracy of kernel methods in successfully forecasting different classes of dynamical systems (periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic) both in data scarce and data rich regimes. The overall methodology may have a wider impact as an effective way to for computing kernel regression.
